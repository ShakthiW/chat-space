This is a Next.js and React application with TailwindCSS that uses the Git4 Summarizer API from RapidAPI to summarize articles.

## Getting Started

1. Install Next.js and the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

To summarize an article, simply enter the URL of the article in the input field and click the "Summarize" button. The application will then generate a summary of the article and display it below.

## API

The application uses the Git4 Summarizer API from RapidAPI to summarize articles. The API key for the API is stored in the `.env` file. To obtain an API key, you will need to create an account on RapidAPI.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `public` directory containing the static files for the application. You can then deploy the static files to a hosting provider such as Netlify or Vercel.
